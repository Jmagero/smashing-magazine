# Smashing Magazine: Design Teardown

> In this project we worked on getting famiiarized on how UX and UI worked; we build the smashingmagazine.com website from head to toes without the images and using a grey-scaled heatmap. The main purpose of the project was to understand the different techniques to direct the users towards the content we want them to see first.

The original websites first articles are responsive; under 1866px wide it displays the first 4 articles 2 on top and 2 on bottom. On wider resolutions it displays 3 or 4 inline articles. We worked based on the 1866px resolution and the articles are not responsive, so if you look at it on a wider resolution please consider zooming in to be able to appreciate the website as it was coppied.
